 * Class: ContentGroup
 *
 * A content group subclass that implements the card interface.
 *
 * This is used for selections of selections. For example if you have
 * a selection of sets, each of those sets may in turn contain subsets.
 * In that scenario each subset would be a Card.ContentGroup - that is,
 * it would be backed by a model, and yet would create it's own arrangement
 * and child cards as well.
