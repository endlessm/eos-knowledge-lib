fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Creating a shard with Basin \nThe tool that we use to turn a hatch into a shard is called Basin. Basin is available as part of the Endless SDK. The easiest way to use it is inside the Flatpak sandbox of the Endless SDK. If you haven t installed it yet check how to do so in the Install section. \nBasin is actually a suite of related tools for creating shards from content on disk not only from hatches. The tool we ll use is called basin hatch. It also downloads the videos that we didn t download in the previous section. \nFirst start a command shell in the Flatpak sandbox and give it permission to access the internet to download the videos and the ingester directory to write the shard \nNOTE Use exit to get out of the shell when you re done with it. \nNext create a file inside the hatch directory called hatch_sets.json with the following content \nThis file is needed because we want to categorize our content ourselves instead of letting basin hatch do it automatically based on the Wordpress tags from the ingester. We ll do this in the next section. \nThen create a directory to hold the output and run basin hatch on the hatch directory \nYou should see the videos being downloaded and finally the message Successfully created content output.shard. \nNOTE If you included the code from the previous section in your ingester you have to do this step quickly after creating the hatch. The Vimeo download links will expire after some time. \nLooking at the content directory there are actually two files in it \nThese files are the form in which the content is ultimately given to the user We ll learn what to do with them in the next section of the walkthrough. \n", "url": "tutorial/shard.html#creating-a-shard-with-basin"});
