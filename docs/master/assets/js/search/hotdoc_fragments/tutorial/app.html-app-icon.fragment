fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "App icon \nWhen you run the app you can see in your taskbar or app switcher Alt Tab that the app is represented by a blank missing image icon. This doesn t look very good so we should do something about it. \nWe ve already prepared an app icon using the same sheep as we used for the logo. You can find it in the full code right click to download it and save it as assets icon.svg in your app directory. We ve also prepared and pixel PNG versions of the icon which you can also download. \nFlatpak apps can export certain files and an app icon is one of them. In order for the OS to find the icon we also need to export a desktop file. \nTo do this first add the icon files to the Flatpak manifest \nThen create a file named org.example.CreativeCommonsBlog.desktop \nAlso add it to the Flatpak manifest \nThen add some new commands to the array of build commands in the Flatpak manifest to install the files in the location where they will be exported and with the correct names \nNow when you rebuild the app you should notice a few lines near the end of the build process mentioning that these four files are being exported. And when you run the app you ll see the icon. \n", "url": "tutorial/app.html#app-icon"});
