fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Publishing the app \nThe app is complete now It includes content categorization a user interface theming a logo an icon and credits and it all works without being connected to the internet. \nAt this point you can simply take the test.flatpak bundle rename it to something more descriptive and publish it as is on your website upload it to Dropbox or some other way of getting your file to your users \nIn this walkthrough we chose the approach of exporting and distributing the app as a single file Flatpak bundle. You could also take the Flatpak repository and publish that instead. That way users of the app could continue to get updates through the repository instead of having to download a new bundle every time. \nYou may have figured out that once you distribute this app it won t get any updates as new posts are published on the blog. The simplest solution is to re run the ingester re build the Flatpak bundle and re publish it every time you want to include new posts. That can even be automated. However it can get tedious. \nOne idea is to write a separate manifest for the rotating content and include build extension true in order to build an org.example.CreativeComments.Content extension that can be updated separately from the main app. This is what Endless does with many applications and it s the reason why we split the sets.json shard from the content shard produced by the ingester. \n", "url": "tutorial/app.html#publishing-the-app"});
