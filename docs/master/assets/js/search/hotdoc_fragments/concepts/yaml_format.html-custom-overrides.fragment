fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Custom Overrides \nThere are other cases where app creators need to customize parts of a preset that are not exposed with variables. In these cases custom overrides can be used as the example below \nIn this example a custom override was added to the overrides section to customize a node that is not exposed with a variable. Instead of a variable name the node identifier is composed of the names of the nodes from the root node to the target node forming a path e.g. root.window.content. \nThe benefit of this feature is that app creators can modify any portion of the preset. But power comes with a price these paths can change if the preset changes its structure e.g. during a refactor of the preset. In that case the custom override will be ignored. Therefore use this override method with care and always double check when porting apps to newer major versions of the framework. \n", "url": "concepts/yaml_format.html#custom-overrides"});
