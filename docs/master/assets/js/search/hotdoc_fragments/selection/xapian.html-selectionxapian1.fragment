fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Selection.Xapian \nA general superclass for populating selection content using xapian queries. Note that this superclass cannot be used directly itself. You must subclass it and implement the construct_query_object method which should return a Eknc.QueryObject determining what content to fetch from a xapian database. \nThis superclass handles continuation passing on the queue_load_more method. If the selection determines that both more results are available by examining the result set metadata returned from xapian and that more results are required it will automatically create a new query and fetch more content. \n", "url": "selection/xapian.html#selectionxapian1"});
