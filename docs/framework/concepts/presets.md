# Presets

The Modular framework has been used for building dozens of apps. As a result, many experience patterns have emerged and turned into pre-defined app experiences or presets. These presets can be re-used and customized by app developers to create new apps. This document is meant to present and describe each of these presets.

## Library

![The Library preset](images/presets/library.svg)

Library is a focused experience that guides the user directly to the content through categories. The preset highlights a few featured categories first before revealing all categories, and integrates a table of contents in the article view. Recommended for long-form educational content.

* **Requires** one level of categories.
* Supports HTML, PDF, video and audio articles.

To use it, include this in your app's YAML:

```yaml
!import 'library'
```

## Blog

Blog is an exploratory experience that starts the user off with fresh content on the homepage, and integrates a fixed side menu for ease of navigation between categories (if the content has categories). If the user can't find what they're looking for, the app will suggest new content. Recommended for blog posts from individual authors.
