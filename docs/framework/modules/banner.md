Banner
======

Banners represent a piece of data which is presented to the user, such as an app's logo or a search term.

There are two banners that are used for app logos: `Banner.App`, which displays a logo containing a wordmark, with an optional subtitle, and `Banner.Dynamic`, which displays a wordless logo separate from the app's title.
The latter has more options for displaying it, but the former is simpler.
